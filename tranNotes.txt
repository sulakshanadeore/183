Why TransactionScope?
1)Transaction Scope is better option
because it can be used for any number of transactions in the  scope.
2)It allows you to nest calls to other methods  that might require the tran.
3) With transope as long the scope exists it will handle everything.
This makes your code clean and more maintainable.
